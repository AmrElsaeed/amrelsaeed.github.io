            <h3>Room Reservation System</h3>
            <p>In my recent project, I developed a room reservation system capable of booking various types of spaces, such as seminar rooms or conference halls. The project was created individually using Python for the backend and the Tkinter library for the GUI. The system requires users to input and validate five parameters: name, room number, date, start time, and end time. Input validation ensures that only clean and correctly formatted data is accepted. Errors are communicated to the user through prompt messages.</p>
            <p>The system's core functionality involves checking the availability of the specified room during the provided time slot. If the room is available, the system books it and records the booking details in a CSV file-based database. If the room is not available, an error message notifies the user of the time conflict.</p>
            <p>To ensure the reliability of the system, I implemented comprehensive unit test cases for each function using the Pytest framework.</p>
            <p>The choice of Python as the primary language was driven by its ease of implementation for this project.</p>
            <p>During the development process, I encountered several challenges. Integrating the backend with the frontend was initially challenging, as I had developed the backend first and then integrated the GUI. In hindsight, I believe it would have been more efficient to begin with the frontend.</p>
            <p>Another notable challenge arose during the process of checking room availability. I needed to extract start and end times from the CSV file and validate if the specified time slot intersected with any existing bookings. Overcoming this obstacle required working with the datetime library and converting data to time objects, which presented a considerable learning curve.</p>
