            <h3>Web Search Engine        <a href="https://github.com/AmrElsaeed/Google-Search-Engine-Replica">GitHub Repo</a></h3>
            <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>The Keyword Search Interface project is a web application built using the Flask framework and integrated with the Bing Web Search API. The application allows users to perform keyword-based searches, displaying relevant search results along with titles and snippets. Users can click on the titles to visit the corresponding pages. The project serves as a simplified version of mainstream search engines, demonstrating the implementation of a functional web search interface. It showcases the use of Flask for web development and integrates external data retrieval through the Bing Web Search API.</p>

    <h4>Features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>User-friendly interface for keyword-based web searches</li>
        <li>Integration of Bing Web Search API for retrieving search results</li>
        <li>Display of search results with clickable titles and descriptive snippets</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Flask: A lightweight Python-based web framework for building web applications</li>
        <li>Bing Web Search API: An external API for retrieving search results from the Bing search engine</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Challenges Faced:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>API Integration: Integrating the Bing Web Search API with Flask required understanding API usage, authentication, and data handling.</li>
        <li>Frontend Design and User Experience: Designing an intuitive and responsive frontend for a smooth user experience was a key challenge.</li>
        <li>Data Security: Ensuring secure practices to handle the API key and protect sensitive data was crucial.</li>
        <li>Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to deal with potential issues during data retrieval and display.</li>
        <li>Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly testing the application to ensure functionality and performance under different scenarios was vital.</li>
    </ol>

            <h3>Room Reservation System        <a href="https://github.com/AmrElsaeed/CS50P-Final-Project">GitHub Repo</a> </h3>
                 <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>The room reservation system is a Python-based application with a Tkinter GUI, designed to facilitate bookings for various spaces, including seminar rooms and conference halls. The system ensures input validation for five parameters: name, room number, date, start time, and end time, accepting only properly formatted data and communicating errors through prompt messages. Its core functionality includes checking room availability during specific time slots, booking available rooms, and recording details in a CSV file-based database. Python was chosen for its ease of implementation, facilitating the development process.</p>
                        <h4>Features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Input validation for five parameters: name, room number, date, start time, and end time</li>
                                <li>Dynamic room availability check during specified time slots</li>
                                <li>CSV file-based database for recording booking details</li>
                            </ul>
            
                <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python: Backend development for the reservation system</li>
                        <li>Tkinter: Python library for creating the graphical user interface</li>
                    </ul>        
                <h4>Challenges Faced:</h4>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Backend-Frontend Integration: Integrating the backend with the frontend posed initial challenges, prompting the realization that commencing with frontend development might have been more efficient.</li>
                    <li>Room Availability Check: Extracting start and end times from the CSV file and validating overlapping time slots demanded extensive work with the datetime library and data conversion, presenting a significant learning curve.</li>
                    </ol>
